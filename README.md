# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ifan!

🎓 I'm a physics undergraduate at Institut Teknologi Bandung with a deep interest in data science, geophysics, and the future of energy. I enjoy learning through projects—especially where coding meets physical intuition and real-world impact.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- **Seismic Data Processing**  
  Learning seismic theory and processing techniques (deconvolution, migration, NMO, etc.) through a comprehensive course on Udemy.
- **Forecasting & Analytics**  
  Building a hybrid demand forecasting project using time series models, machine learning, and spectral analysis methods.

## 🧰 Languages & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Git, VS Code  
- **Currently Learning:** ObsPy, Seismic Unix (SU), PyTorch

## 📂 Featured Projects
- 🔬 **Comprehensive Demand Forecasting & Error Analysis**  
  Time series + ML + Fourier methods for improved inventory planning.
- 🌍 **Seismic Data Exploration**  
  Personal learning repo from Udemy course covering filters, NMO, migration, etc.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Seismic imaging workflows & geophysical processing  
- AI & ML methods for time series prediction  
- Geophysical software tools (ObsPy, SU)
